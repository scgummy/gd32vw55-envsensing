# BLE APP UART Example

# Build/download Example

This example can not be moved to other directory unless the example project configuration is modified.

Building the example project can refer to document *AN154 GD32VW553 Quick Development Guide.docx*.

* start GD32EclipseIDE, import example project, select the directory MSDK\examples\ble\peripheral\ble_app_uart\eclipse.
* configure ToolChain and Build Tool.
* build project, after compilation the image will be saved in the directory MSDK\examples\ble\peripheral\ble_app_uart\eclipse\ble_app_uart_out.
* use GDLINK/JLINK or dragging it into the USB disk to download image.

# Using Example

After powering up, start board will directly send advertising whose adv data include device name.

*  if using lightblue for testing, connection should be establised manually, and tool Husky should bu used on start board side.
*  if using another start board for testing, ble_app_uart_c image should be downloaded to it. Power up both sides, the connection will be establised automaticlly. Both sides need tool Husky for testing. Please send or receive uart data by Husky.
